I was born in Massachusetts and raised in a little town where the biggest attractions are two super Walmarts and [a giant milk bottle]('https://www.facebook.com/THEMILKBOTTLE/'). 

I was raised by several family members, most notably my mother, and was always passionate about finding a career in biology. Finding a cure to any kind of cancer is a heavy goal, but one that I'm driven by. Once I decided I didn't want to go to medical school, I discovered my interest in programming. Taking that in stride with my love for math, I fell into the rabbit hole of machine learning. 

And now, I'm using what I've learned to advance drug discovery!

In my personal time, I enjoy music, exercising, cooking, hiking and spending time with my family. I also like to keep up with ongoing developments in neuroscience. Though I've been out of the field for a while, I still apply the lessons learned from working on the bench and simulating neural circuits to my current work. Below are some random images I pulled together from back when I did more 'hands-on' science!
