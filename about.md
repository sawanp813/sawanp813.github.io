I was born in Massachusetts and raised in a little town where the biggest attractions are two super Walmarts and [a giant milk bottle]('https://www.facebook.com/THEMILKBOTTLE/'). 

I was raised by several family members, most notably my mother, and was always passionate about finding a career in biology. Finding a cure to any kind of cancer is a heavy goal, but one that I'm driven by. Once I decided I didn't want to go to medical school, I discovered my interest in programming. Taking that in stride with my love for math, I fell into the rabbit hole of machine learning. 

And now, I'm using what I've learned to advance drug discovery!

In my personal time, I enjoy music, exercising, cooking, hiking and spending time with my family. I am also a contributor to [**Alien Daydreams**](https://www.aliendaydreams.life/), an artistic collective based in San Francisco, CA - check it out!
