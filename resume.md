## Experience

`2023-`
__BLISS Machine Learning Researcher/Intern, Probabalistic Machine Learning Group, University of Michigan__ Contributed to the development an amortized variational intference model for cataloging deep space astronomical images trained on simulated multi-bandpass images. Expanded the encoding and simulation of single-band deep-space astronomical images to multi-band images, developed several Gaussian Mixture Model color priors trained on flux data across several surveys to simulate survey-specific synthetic images, made various optimizations to the encoder architecture, statistical prior for catalog generation and more.

`2020-23`
__Researcher, Laboratory of Computational Neurophysiology__ Created a model of spatial navigation to contextualize the discovery of bidirectional head direction cells in the rodent retrosplenial cortex. Publication pending.

`2018-20`
__Research Assistant, Laboratory of Neural Development & Intellectual Disorders__ Assisted PhD students with diagnostic methods for better understanding rodent models of down syndrome. Techniques include PCR, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy and cell counting.

## Education

`2022-23`
__Master of Science in Computer Science & Engineering, University of Michigan__

***GPA 3.91:*** A - Natural Language Processing, A - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence, A - GPU Programming, A - Database Management Systems, A - Web Development

`2018-2022`
__Bachelor of Arts in Neuroscience (Minor in Computer Science), Boston University__

***GPA 3.88:*** Magna Cum Laude; A - Machine Learning, A - Introduction to Data Science, A- - Discrete Math, A - Algorithms, A - Data Structures

## University Leadership & Involvement

`2020-22`
__President, Hindu Students Council__ Organized several cultural events on-campus for as many as 2,500 attendees at once. Raised a total revenue of $51,000 in '21-'22. Organized several charitable efforts serving the Boston community in association with Engineers Without Borders and Overseas Volunteers for a Better India.

`2018-20`
__Writer & Editor, The Nerve Journal__ Wrote a published article describing the effects of solitary confinement on the cognitive abilities of inmates. Edited several other published articles.

`2018-20`
__Member - Mind & Brain Society__ Taught basic neuroscience concepts to underpriviledged youth at the Roxbury Community Center to foster a better understanding of the human brain and to expose the subject to the children for future inspiration.

## Projects

- COVID-19 vs Viral/Bacterial Pneumonia Classification

Study, experiment with and develop several neural architectures and their performance on a supervised classification problem involving patient chest x-rays where models were trained to 'diagnose' patients. Architectures explored involved VGG-16, ResNet and DenseNet.

- Multivariate Normal Parameter Estimation
Use the expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the parameters of a multivariate normal distribution only given a set of data generated from the distribution. Performance was compared to a simple maximum-likelihood estimation method.

- Google clone

A search engine web application that utilizes PageRank, and tf-idf to evaluate the relevance of pages stored in an index to user queries. Computation was performed via Hadoop (distributed computing) on an inverted index, processed through a Flask application and returned to a server-side dynamic front-end with interactive capabilities.
